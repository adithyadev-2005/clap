# CLAP-TO-SCROLL!! üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: ZERO ONE


### Team Members
- Team Lead: RIDHA FATHIMA - LBSCEK
- Member 2: ADITHYA DEV P - LBSCEK


### Project Description
A fun web application that allows you to scroll through content by clapping! The app uses your microphone to detect clapping sounds and scrolls the page accordingly.

### The Problem 
Sometimes scrolling with a mouse or keyboard is just too‚Ä¶ mainstream
### The Solution
Make the browser listen for claps and scroll automatically ‚Äî because why not?
[How are you solving it? Keep it fun!]
We use your device microphone to capture sound, run it through a clap detection algorithm, and trigger page scroll events depending on the intensity and number of claps. The louder or more frequent the claps, the more the page scrolls.



## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Languages used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Frameworks used: None (vanilla JS fun!)
- Libraries used: p5.js (sound library) / Web Audio API
- Tools used: VS Code, GitHub, Cursor ai


For Hardware:
Any device with a microphone

### Implementation
For Software:
1. Accesses microphone with user permission.
2. Continuously listens for sound input.
3. Detects specific ‚Äúclap‚Äù patterns using amplitude thresholds.
4. Maps clap count/intensity to scrolling speed/distance.
5. Enjoy scrolling like a rockstar.
